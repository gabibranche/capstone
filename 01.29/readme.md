## Updates


I have been working on multiple little elements of my project in hope of coming to a larger result. I worked on the fire graphics and now need to test it as a projection. I also mapped out the led lights for the tree using a combination of neopixel strips and string. I met with Jon Bonner to work on the wooden prototype for the trees. I also did some research to find stories of the character to use in the final gallery room and tossled with the idea of having there be some physical copies of the book as well. 

See links below for progress:
