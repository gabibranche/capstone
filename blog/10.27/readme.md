## Updates:

I have continured working on the prototypes for the Soucouyant and Papa Bois. 

## What I did

### Soucouyant

After some trial and error I was able to get the flame to map onto the visual capture. However it is not very smooth. I think the lighting might be part of the issue and or the fact that I have darker skin. I want to user tesr with someone else but I am not allowed to have more people in my studio so I will have to put that on the back burner for now and continue figuring out how to do full body projection. 

The first step was to map the flame onto the video capture to ensure that it was actually following the face. See [here](https://youtu.be/ZWt9PVc6I3w)

The second step was to remove the vide so that only the flame could be seen to be projected onto the dancer. See [here](https://youtu.be/ZWt9PVc6I3w).

### Papa Bois

I started working on Prototypes for the trees. 

I looked up some set designes for forest and used those to create my own set.

From this I drafted up my own set that I realised should incorporate both real plants and the LED trees.

After this I created a smaller prototype tree. The goal is to create 3-4 larger versions in the seam shop next semester.

The next step is to add the neopixels but I'm not sure how to include all of them with minimal wiring. 


## Next Steps

The next steps would be work on the body mapping and continue developping the tree. I would also like to start working on another character, perhaps the douens.
