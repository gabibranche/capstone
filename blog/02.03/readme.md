# Blog Post #1 

Updates: This week I focused on the dancers and recruitment. 

I hosted two interest meetings with a brief presentation of what the project entails and the process for taking part. I also created a form that was sent out out to register for auditions which will haopen at the end of the week. I am very excited to be working with this students.
Additionally, I reached out to my former professor Danielle Russo to see if she would be willing to be on my capstone panel. I am still waiting on a response but inshallah she will answer soon or I will follow up. 

My follow up meeting with Jon Bonner is scheduled for tomorrow so there will probably be more updates next week concerning the trees.

Since most of the stuff I worked on are logistical, there aren't really photos to show for it. Inshallah next week's post will be more visual.
