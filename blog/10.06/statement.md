# Gabrielle Branche: Artist Statement

I have always been deeply immersed in the arts having started dancing, singing, writing, and acting from a very tender age. Nevertheless, I had interests beyond the arts particularly in the STEM field. Interactive Media provided me with a space to combine all my passions by allowing me to create intersectional art.

I started off my tertiary education pursuing biology and still find the field very interesting. However, after being exposed to Interactive Media, I believed that I could use art and technology to make scientific content more accessible. The class Making Education in NYUAD’s Interactive Media program played a big role in my transition into the major. While I have since shifted more to performative pieces, I was initially drawn to Interactive Media by the thought of creating VR content that focused on hard to grasp concepts. Some of my earliest projects dealt with scientific representation, including using robotics to explore the physical and mental behaviour of animals and data physicalization to promote eco-friendly lifestyles.

While I still find pleasure in creating educational VR content, recently I have been homing in on my experience in the performing arts. As a performer, I am constantly finding ways to integrate technology into the performing arts. I am constantly abstracting the lessons that are rooted in the arts to explore different themes and to stimulate thought-provoking ideas.

We live in a world in which technology is rapidly being normalized in all spheres of life and I am a firm believer that the arts should not be left behind. However, while some forms of art such as music and visual art are more conducive to these changes, in the forms of art to which I am drawn, namely dance and theater, this transition is more difficult.

I use my knowledge of technology to explore intersectional and educational art. By using physical computing, remote sensors, and AR technology, I specify in creating immersive dance and theatrical pieces. I found inspiration in works such as Tokyo’s TeamLab Galleries, Artechouse in New York, and Third Rail Projects such as Then She Fell. These projects have prompted me to further explore the integration of the physical and the digital. I strive to make art that can exist in a transient space where technology, audience and performer coexist.

As an artist who frequently integrates AR technology into my pieces, I have often thought of how Augmented Reality and Smart Technology will shape our world in the near and distant future. Tying back to my overall aim of creating intersectional art, I have worked on pieces that use theater and robotics to explore these themes.

Coming from the small twin island of Trinidad and Tobago, I am driven to integrate my local culture into many of my pieces. Wherever possible, I include elements of our rich music, history and diversity in my work, in an attempt to bring Trinidadian culture to the global forefront. 

As is evident by this statement, my art is diverse and complex. It is a tapestry woven together by visual and performing arts, technology, and education. My work spans the entire breadth of the Art umbrella and continues to grow as I continue to learn.
