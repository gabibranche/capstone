## Updates:

I spent this week working on my statements and also trying to figure out facial recognition as I haven't used video capture libraries before.


## What I did: 

I was able to figure out how to track face using processing. 
See [link](https://youtu.be/PGvaKC6nB34) for details.

I limited to facial recognition as I didn't yet have a projetor to track body movement and also wanted to start small since I am now learning the libraries. I have finally received equipment from the lab so now. I can work on making more physical prototypes.

I also prepared for my presentation today.

## Next Steps:

The next step would be working on body tracking and then improving the graphic that goes with the body tracking.
