## Updates: 
I was supposed to look into kinect and work on audio and the LED Forest

## What I did:

### Soucouyant

I started by refamiliarizing myself with kinect. Then I started integrating the flame. 
I will have to work on manipulateling the threshold and making her movements affect the flames more now.

See video of progress [here]()

### Douens

I was able to get record and playback to work by exploring the Minim library. I looked into manipulating the sound but haven't reached that far yet. Will look into it more in the future.

See video of progress [here]()

## Next steps

I will continue working with the Kinect and crack down on making the neopixels work. 

I will also do some logisitcal things like reaching out to costume shop etc
