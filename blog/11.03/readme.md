## Updates

The tasks for this week was to work on body capture and to start working on the douens.


## What I did.


### Soucouyant

After trying to make body capture work with OpenCV, I emailed Aaron for assistance who told me that it would be better to use kinect. As such I requested a Kinect and I am waiting to receive it from the Lab


### Douens

THe Douens story states that if the Douens hear a child's name after dark they will call out to the child and lure them into the forest. As such I want to record the audience saying their names after they enter and replay them more distorted in the douens scene. 

I worked on recording via processing and saving the recording. The next step would be to link it to audacity or another program so that I could distort it.

## Next Steps

The next steps would be to try body capture after reciving the kinect. Reach out to Michael about the Neopixel wiring for the Papa Bois Scene and to link the audio for the douens.
