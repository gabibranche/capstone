# Blog Post #3:

## Updates: 

I met with the Arts Center and finalized the details of my performance in the Black Box. The tentative dates are March 28th - April2nd (yikes). Additionally, my panel was finalised and the date set for Monday 26th April. 

## What I did:

The Script was finalized and could be read [here](SouS2.pdf)

Additionally I am supposed to receive the first prototypes of the trees tomorrow (Wednesday)

I also started working with Sox but came into some admin level challenges and I am waiting on Jack to respond to move on with that.

I also chose my dancers and reached out to them sharing their roles.

Finally, I continued improving the Soucouyant. The video of the improvement can be found [here]()

## Next Steps

Once Jack follows up with the Sox I will work on that.
Once I receive the trees I will start wiring them up
